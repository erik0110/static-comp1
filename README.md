KenGriffeyJr.

This web page was designed containing all of the content and "boxes" with icons. These were stored in a a <main> element. I then put each box in an <article> element with seperate classes. I stored the image of Ken Griffey Jr and the icons that sit on top inside of an <aside> element. With this approach it made styling easier. 

The CSS got a little un-organized, but the design came out close to what I expected. The page became responsive by adding 4 media queries. The boxes, images and fonts all changeacoording to pixels available for the user. I also added a transform element with a hover attribute, which was something cool I haven't done before.

Some issues with my project I had or wish I would have done differently...
 1). I tried to re-factor to put all the icons and content in my HTML code, but ran into some issues and went back to how I started.  I think this would have made things a little more organized, and my articles/boxes would have been easier to move around and modify.
 2). I wanted to use flex-box on the right-side of the page, but had some issues with the arrows and page-markers. They weren't ascting kindly to eachother so I seperated them using a float, and position:relative. When making the page responsive, this would have made things a little easier. 
 3). Seeing a few other students projects, I wish I would have altered the looks of the layout to be a little more unique. 
 4). Last but not least, I really wish I would have re-factored my code. Its pretty unorganized, ugly, redundant and I tend to get lost in my own code. Yikes.
